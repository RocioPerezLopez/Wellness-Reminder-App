## Problem Statement
Many existing wellness apps focus on mental health, fitness, or simple reminders, but these solutions do not deeply personalize their recommendations to the **specific needs** of various professional profiles. As a student of **Health and Social Care**, I’ve recognized that a holistic approach must consider the unique stressors, mobility, and nutritional needs of different professions to effectively support wellbeing.

For example:
- **Programmers** face issues such as cognitive strain, poor posture, and eye fatigue due to prolonged hours in front of a screen.
- **Construction Workers** need guidance on **injury prevention**, hydration, and muscle recovery due to physically demanding tasks.
- **Teachers** face high levels of mental exhaustion, voice strain, and standing for long periods.
- **Healthcare Workers**, such as **nurses and doctors**, require support with **stress management**, physical strain from long shifts, and emotional burnout from dealing with high-pressure environments.
  
Without profession-specific wellness advice, many apps fall short in supporting the full spectrum of a person's physical, mental, and emotional needs.

- **AI-driven wellness apps** are favored for their ability to **tailor advice** to the user's lifestyle and work habits.
- Existing apps like **Sanvello** and **Happify** provide general wellness support but don't address specific professional demands such as preventing eye strain for programmers or helping healthcare workers recover after long shifts.
